### The Project

Transacter was made to show transaction history of a user. I utilized the structure given to me although I think there are certain improvements that can be made, they are:

1. I think the data should be paginated.

2. The date should either be a filter or just a dropdown where the user can easily pick a period and the transactions will render.

Both improvements above will help improve user experience.
